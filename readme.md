# Game Enums
- a more readable way of defining certain values
- `GameState`: if on menu, playing, etc
- `Direction`: the direction a given actor is facing
- `Images`: could have defined constants for images but it feels better to group them all in an enum

# GameController
- runs everything. the main game loop is part of this class and it holds all actors
